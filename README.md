# MTSClient
A simple open-source client to help with gaming tournament casting
A standalone executable is available in the Stand-alone Executable folder, just download it and you're good to go.
The client will generate all of the files it needs when you hit the 'Update All' button.

The project was developed in Visual Studio 2010, so if you want to make changes I'd suggest using Visual Studio 2010 or later.
